## Uninstallation

On Mac OS X you drop the application from the Application folder to your Trash. 
But there are some user specific files are kept elsewhere, which are located under 
`$HOME/Library/Application Support/Syncthing`. The files in this folder are the configuration,
encryption/profile files and the database cache. For more information see [docs.syncthing.net/users/config.html](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/config.html#description).
